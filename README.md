# California-s-houses
Building a machine learning model using linear regression. Using the Sklearn Library.
The dataset used contains data on the value of real estate in the counties of California.
The goal of the project is to teach a machine learning model to determine the potential value of a house based on new received data.
Linear regression was chosen for training.
Here I am calculating the root mean square error (RMSE). This way you can use the target indicator scale, which is easier to understand.
The learning curve displays the error function (MSE) with different amounts of data used for training. File1.png
It is often very useful in machine learning to have a confidence interval around the scores. 
There are various ways to do this, but one fairly common method is to use bootstrap. File2.png
